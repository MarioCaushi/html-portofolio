<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am currently in my second year of study and my goal is to to study and learn as much as possible about technology and programming so i can succeed and breakthrough later on in my career.</p>

<p>I am very passionate about what i do and what i am learning and this is why i am taking extra classes and studying hard outside of my program to gain the extra and hopefully useful knowledge and experience.</p>
